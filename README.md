Weather Dashboard

# About
Developed with the skills I learnt at the bootcamp during the third week of coding boot camp experience at Columbia University, NY. Date of publication: 10/14/2020.

This website is designed using CSS bootstrap and incorporates responsive design attributes. The Weather dashboard is designed using a Weather API (Application Processing Interface) from https://openweathermap.org/api

An application programming interface (API) is a computing interface which defines interactions between multiple software intermediaries. Through information hiding, APIs enable modular programming, which allows users to use the interface independently of the implementation. For further details, please refer to the following link

jQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library. It makes things like HTML document traversal and manipulation, event handling, animation, and Ajax much simpler with an easy-to-use API that works across a multitude of browsers.
